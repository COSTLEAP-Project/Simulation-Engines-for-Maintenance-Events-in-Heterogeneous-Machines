# Simulation-Engines-for-Maintenance-Events-in-Heterogeneous-Machines
Two feature-driven engines that generate realistic historical maintenance logs that can be used to train learning algorithms. The TBM engine simulates failures, preventive actions, and costs, while the CBM engine produces stochastic degradation paths and corresponding maintenance events.
